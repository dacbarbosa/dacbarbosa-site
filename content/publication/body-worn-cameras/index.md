abstract: We provide experimental evidence that monitoring of the police activity through body-worn cameras reduces use-of-force, handcuffs and arrests,and enhances criminal           reporting. Stronger treatment effects occur on events classified *ex-ante* of low           seriousness. Monitoring effects are moderated by officer rank, which is consistent with a     career concern motive by junior officers. Overall, results show that the use of body-worn     cameras de-escalates conflicts.
