I am an MPhil/DPhil student at the [Department of Economics, University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) and a member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/). Previously to joining Oxford, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Thiemo Fetzer](http://www.trfetzer.com/) and [Prof. Pedro CL Souza](https://www.pedroclsouza.com/).

I have worked on topics in conflict and crime, with a focus on interventions that change the incentive structure around hidden action issues in policing activity and criminal reporting.
